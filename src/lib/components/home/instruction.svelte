				This coffee was grown by El Porvenir Cooperative on the steep slopes surrounding Laguna de
				Ayarza in the Santa Rosa Department of southeastern Guatemala. Famous for its natural
				beauty, Laguna de Ayarza is a high elevation double caldera. Approximately 20,000 years ago,
				two different catastrophic volcanic eruptions caused two intertwined volcanos to collapse
				into the earth, thus creating the lake and blanketing the region in mineral-rich pumice. The
				area's fertile volcanic soil, consistent rainfall, warm days, and cool nights are perfect
				for specialty coffee cultivation and promote slow cherry maturation. Coffee from this region
				is famous for being sweet and dense.
